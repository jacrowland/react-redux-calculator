# Javascript Calculator

## Made with React and Redux

This simple calculator app was built using HTML, CSS, JS, React and Redux - the state management framework. After becoming more familiar with React this project allowed me to leverage what I had learnt about using state, props, and hooks to build a more complex app with clearly defined actions (add, subtrack, clear etc.) These actions are handled by Reducer functions that allow for the the entire application's state to be stored in an app level store - this provides a single source of truth and removes the need for repeated prop drilling (the passing of parameters between components - even if they go unused by that component).
